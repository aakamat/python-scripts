Thank you for your interest in Scrabbler. It is a hobby script and in fact, the second python program I have ever written in my life.
Scrabbler is a Scrabble Helper script that will generate word list that matches the current rack position. 
It will also give you point scores for every word.
It can handle blank tiles on the rack and will score accordingly.
It can handle Double and Triple Word / Letter scores at specified letter positions.
